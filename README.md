# Computational Electrophysiology Analysis

This jupyter notebook can be used to analyse Molecular Dynamics  trajectories, where an external electric filed has been applied.

It contains the following functionalities:

* It calculates the positions along the z-axis of the anions, cations and water molecules that are found at each time frame in a cylinder centered at the center of mass of the ion channel.
 By plotting these positions, the ion crossing events, as long as the hydration of the pore as a function of time can be examined.

* It computes and plots key intersubunit distances at constriction points of the ion channel, which show the degree of channel opening.

* It plots the cumulative number of ion permeation events as a functyion of time.
